Install 3 VM's or 3 physical machines with internet connectivity..

Perform the following operations as a root user in all three nodes

1. Stop and disable the firewalld
      # systemctl stop firewalld
      # systemctl disable firewalld
      
2. Set the SELinux policies at Permissive mode in all three nodes
      # setenforce 0
      
3. update the hostname in all three nodes
      # hostname <anyhostname>
      Ex: hostname server
          hostname node1
          hostname node2
          
4. update /etc/hosts file in all three nodes  //  [Enter the ip address from each host]
        Ex: 192.168.10.23   server
            192.168.10.24   client1
            192.168.10.25   client2
            
5. Create a user ansible in all three nodes
        Ex: 
            useradd ansible
            
6. Set password for ansible user in all three node
        Ex: passwd ansible
        
7. Add the user ansible to sudoers list using the following command in all three nodes
        # cat >> /etc/sudoers     //After typing this command, press enter...then type the following command and press ctrl + c
        
        ansible ALL=(ALL) ALL

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Perform the following operations in server node as a ansible user

8. Generate RSA key from server host as a ansible user
      $ ssh-keygen      //press enter for all default options

9. Copy the key to all the client nodes (Ensure that you are in home directory while typing this command)
      $ ssh-copy-id ansible@client1
      $ ssh-copy-id ansible@client2

10. Create a directory under home directory (directory name can be any valid identifier)
      $ mkdir playbook

11. Change the current directory to playbook
      $ cd playbook
      
12. Create ansible.cfg file and add the contents as mentioned in the following link
    
        $ vi ansible.cfg    //Enter the contents from the link below 
        
          https://github.com/ctgopinaath/ansible/blob/ansible-intro-playbooks/ansible.cfg

13. Create a file hosts under playbook directory with following contents

        $ vi hosts
        
          [group1]
          client1
          [group2]
          client2

At end of 13 steps the environemnt setup to run ansible playbooks are ready!!!!
